* What are the key features of Python?
* How do python achieve multiple inheritance
* What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it?
* -- We use *args when we aren't sure how many arguments are going to be * passed to
* a function, or if we want to pass a stored list or tuple of arguments to a
* function.
* **kwargs is used when we don't know how many keyword arguments will be * passed to
* a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as * keyword
* arguments.
* The identifiers args and kwargs are a convention, you could also use bob * and
* **billy but that would not be wise.
